Angular 14 CRUD with .NET 6 Web API using Entity Framework Core


We will perform Angular CRUD operations.
As our API we will use ASP.NET Core or .NET 6 to create a Web API from scratch.
This will be a great full-stack web application using two of the greatest languages i.e. Angular and ASP.NET
In our ASP.NET 6 Web API, we will use entity framework core and SQL Server to perform our CRUD operations.
We will create a new database from scratch using EF Core migrations.
In our Angular 14 application, we will create multiple components and we will set up routing for these components as well.
We will use Bootstrap 5 in our Angular website to make beautiful web components.
